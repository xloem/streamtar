# streamtar

streamtar appends live data from stdin to a tarball.
data is preserved in the event of a crash.

Usage: streamtar <tarball>.tar <streamfilename>

## TODO

- [ ] if the size is passed in advance, then no seeking is needed to update it, and the tar blocks can be written to stdout.
      there may be an existing tool that does that.
